# arm-none-eabi-gcc_4_9_BE

Big-endian-enabled (for HardFP and SoftFP) GCC bare-metal toolchain for ARM 

The two folders at the top level of this repo should be self-explanatory 
in their nature. One contains the compiled Linux binary of the 
arm-none-eabi-* toolchain while the other contains the associated source 
code and compilation instructions, pursuant to the standard guidelines 
provided in the typical arm-none-eabi- toolchain source download blob 
from Launchpad or the ARM developer mirror.
