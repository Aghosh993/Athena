# STM32 Cube HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)

This directory holds source and header files for the HAL on the STM32 F3 and F4 line of microcontrollers. The STM32CubeF3 and F4 HAL is used. These files may be combined with code generated by ST's CubeMX tool, by simply dropping the generated user HAL interface code in the user_source/hal_interface and user_include/hal_interface directories of the auto-created project structure generated by running the mkproject.sh scripts provided in this repository.
